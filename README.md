# FriendFinder

This web app allows users to find people with the most similarities among our database. The app first retrieves information from the user and asks 10 questions with a scale of 1 to 5. Then the app will find a person from our database with the least difference in the answers of those questions, and then prompt the name and the picture of the matched person on the page.
